    | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    |
    | Here you may configure your settings for cross-origin resource sharing
    | or "CORS". This determines what cross-origin operations may execute
    | in web browsers. You are free to adjust these settings as needed.
    |
    | IMPORTANT: CORS only applies to browser-based requests (web apps).
    | Mobile apps (Flutter iOS/Android) do NOT have CORS restrictions.
    | This configuration is mainly for:
    | - Flutter Web applications
    | - Web-based admin panels
    | - Development/testing with web browsers
    |
    | To learn more: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
